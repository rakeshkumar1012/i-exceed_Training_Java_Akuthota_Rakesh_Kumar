Day 4 - Java Concepts Practice

1. Accessing Private Members using Reflection
File Name: prvtaccessing.java
Concept: Reflection

This program shows how to access a private method from another class using Java Reflection. The method is made accessible and then invoked.

2. Composition in Java
File Name: composition.java
Concept: Composition

This example shows composition by using one class (state) inside another class (india). The india class has a reference to the state class, which helps show a "has-a" relationship.

3. Functional Interface Example
File Name: functionalinterface.java
Concept: Functional Interface

4. A functional interface is created and implemented using an anonymous inner class. The show method is overridden to print a message. It shows the basic use of functional interfaces.

Encapsulation in Java
File Name: demoencapsulation.java
Concept: Encapsulation

This program shows encapsulation by using private fields with public getters and setters. The values are accessed and modified using these methods, showing proper data hiding.
